### 🚀 Hey there, I'm Raj 👨‍💻✨  

Tech Lead | Software Engineer | Full-time Code Juggler 🤹‍♀️  

💻 **Day-to-Day Stack:**  
- ☕ React.js & Node.js (because sleep is overrated)  
- ⚡ Next.js (for side projects that *might* get finished... one day 😅)  
- 🐍 Django (mostly when my colleague drags me into debugging their bug 🫠)
- ☁ AWS | Alibaba Cloud | Docker | Git (because version control chaos is real)  
- 🛢 **MongoDB & Firebase** (day-to-day survival), **Supabase** (because who has time to build auth from scratch? 😵‍💫)  

🛠 Building cool things, breaking even cooler things, and occasionally pushing code that actually works.  

👀 Probably debugging in the console right now...  

📌 **Fun facts:**  
- 90% of my commits are focused on **optimizing performance & scalability** 🚀  
- The other 10% are **code reviews and debugging edge cases** 🧐  
- And **100% of them are pushed at 2 AM** ⏳💀

💡 Got a cool idea? Make sure it scales first. Then we’ll talk. 🚀
